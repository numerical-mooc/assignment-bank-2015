We have the usual suspects: truncation error, discretization error, possible precision errors. Don't believe that these are significant? Take a look at the following screenshot, which shows the plots above, built with identical code on two different computers. The responses on the left are from a 64-bit computer, and the responses on the right are from a 32-bit computer. Look especially at the phase shift in the system response. That's a huge difference! Even the precision of the machine can have a significant impact on numerical integration.\n",

    "One thing we notice in the plots of position is that for Euler and Runge-Kutta, the spring is stretched farther and farther each oscillation. This means it has more and more potential energy. With no outside forces adding energy to the system and no friction to remove energy, Conservation of Energy says that value should be constant! Let's take a look at total energy in the system. Since we derived equations of motion from the Lagrangian, this should be easy! All we need to do is calculate kinetic and potential energy at each time step, and we already have the information we need to do this. "

    "## Adding a damping term\n",

    "A more realistic oscillator also has a damping term. This might correspond to friction, or to some other non-conservative force. For now, we will assume that the damping is linear, and is proportional to the velocity (this is called the -- model of friction). We get the following equation of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "0 = m\\ddot{x} + c\\dot{x} + kx\n",
    "\\end{equation*}$$\n",

    "This gives us the differential equations:\n",

    "\\vec{\\dot{q}}  = f(\\vec{q}) = \\begin{bmatrix} q_2\\\\ -\\frac{c}{m}\\dot{q_1} -\\frac{k}{m}q_1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euler's method and Runge-Kutta integration work the same way with this new equation. We also have a new analytical solution. Assuming the system is underdamped (add explanation of damping ratio), the solution becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "x(t) = Acos(\\omega_d t + \\phi)\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\omega_d = \\omega_n\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}$ is called the damped natural frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big change comes in the Hamiltonian equations. If these are dependent on convservation of energy, how do we deal with a system where energy is not conserved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to re-examine the Lagrangian. Since losses due to friction are neither potential nor kinetic energy, we'll need a new term. The Lagrangian equation of motion with non-conservative forces is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x_i}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i} = Q\n",

    "$$Q = c\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial t}$$\n",

    "Now that we have this, we can add a similar term to the Hamiltonian equations of motion to deal with the same problem. For more information on the derivation of the Hamiltonian from the Lagrangian, see Tveter (cite). The Hamiltonian equations of motion become:\n",

    "We can see some oscillations in the total energy, which come from the discretization error. Overall, we see again that Verlet performs better here than Euler or Runge-Kutta (although not perfectly - it does have induced oscillations from the damping term), but just like the analytical solution the energy in the system asymptotically approaches zero.\n",

    "Another way to investigate stability is with a phase plot. Instead of position vs. time, we can plot velocity vs. position. This plot is in phase space (a subset of state space). For any given state (position and velocity), we should be able to determine what the next state will be. This gives us an entire direction field, over which we can plot the actual behavior of the system to see if they match up. If the phase plot becomes repetitive, we can call it stable, and if the phase plot goes to the origin, we can call it asymptotically stable."
