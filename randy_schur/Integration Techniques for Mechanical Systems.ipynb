    "Is this what you would expect to see based on the plots of position above? What are the sources of this error? We have the usual suspects: truncation error, discretization error, possible precision errors. But ordinarily we don't see a second order scheme (Verlet) outperforming a fourth order scheme (RK4) by three orders of magnitude. What is going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we notice in the plots of position is that for Euler and Runge-Kutta, the spring is stretched farther and farther each oscillation. This means it has more and more potential energy. With no outside forces adding energy to the system and no friction to remove energy, Conservation of Energy says that value should be constant! Let's take a look at total energy in the system. Since we derived equations of motion from the Lagrangian, this should be easy! All we need to do is calculate kinetic and potential energy at each time step, and we already have the information we need to do this. "

For now, we will assume that the damping is linear, and is proportional to the velocity (this is called the -- model of friction). We get the following equation of motion:\n",

For any given state (position and velocity), we should be able to determine what the next state will be. This gives us an entire direction field, over which we can plot the actual behavior of the system to see if they match up. If the phase plot becomes repetitive, we can call it stable, and if the phase plot goes to the origin, we can call it asymptotically stable."
