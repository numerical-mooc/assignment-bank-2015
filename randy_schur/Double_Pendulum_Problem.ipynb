    "If we look closely at the plot, we can see that Euler and Runge-Kutta integration are close to each other, but begin to diverge as time goes on. This should be the behavior we expect for the integration of a non-linear system. But how close are these methods to the analytical solution? Does Verlet do any better? In this case it is obvious that Euler and Runge-Kutta are not correct (and possible unstable). Let's do an error analysis.\n",

Since we derived equations of motion from the Lagrangian, this should be easy! All we need to do is calculate kinetic and potential energy at each time step, and we already have the information we need to do this. "

This gives us an entire direction field, over which we can plot the actual behavior of the system to see if they match up.
