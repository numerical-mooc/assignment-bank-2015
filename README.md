For submission of class project at GW, Fall 2015

This assignment examines numerical integration techniques using mechanical systems. In the notebook Integration_Techniques_for_Mechanical_Systems, I start by introducing a simple harmonic oscillator and three different types of integrators (Euler, Runge-Kutta, and Verlet). Next I introduce damping and look at how the system behavior changes for each method of integration. The Double_Pendulum_Problem notebook looks at the double pendulum problem using Runge-Kutta and Verlet integration.
